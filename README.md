### Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis was provided by the training institution i am training with, **Digitaley Drive**. The data contained The survey questions and the responses given by the employees of the organization. 

### Tool

PowerBI 

This tool was used for the data cleaning, analysis and the creation of the dashboard.

### Data Transformation

The first thing i did was to download the CSV file and import it into power Query Editor. I noticed There are some empty cells(null values) and the data types of some of the columns were incorrect. I went ahead and  replaced the  empty cells on the response column and response text column and changed the data types of the incorrect columns. Afterwards I went ahead  to create an insightful data visualization using PowerBI dashboard. The dashboard consisted of 7 cards which contained information such as the No of responses(14725), No of questions asked(11), No of department(21), No of staff(1250), No of managers(1071), No of supervisors(1662), and number of directors(170). 2 slicers, 1 clustered bar chart, 1 clustered column chart and 4 area charts.

### Results and Findings

- According to the survey most of the  respondents  agree  that their department is inclusive and support of a diverse workforce, this indicate that the departments do not discriminate and are supportive of employee differences.
- Most of the  respondent disagree that they have a best friend at work This shows lack of team bonding exercise within the organization
- Across roles supervisors has the highest number of respondents (1662), followed by  staff (1250), then manager (1071) and then directors(170). This information indicates that the supervisors and mangers encouraged the staffs to take part in the survey and they did so by leading by example.
- Supervisors, managers, directors and staffs all strongly agree that they know what is expected of them indicating an effective onboarding system and a clearly defined roles and responsibilities in the organization.
- Supervisors, managers and staffs all strongly agree that their supervisor or someone at work seems to care about them as a person showing that employee welfare is top priority for the leaders in the organization
- Most of the respondents strongly disagree that in the last seven days they have received praise or recognition for doing good work, showing a lack of reward system to keep the employees motivated at their job

### Recommendation

- Implement recognition programs to celebrate employee achievements and milestone.
- organize regular team-building events like retreats and group activities and will include fun and interactive exercises that encourage collaboration and bonding
- Provide necessary resources and tools for employees to perform their task effectively
- Define clear career progression paths and communicate them to employees
- Maintain an inclusive and support diverse workforce
